# adaptive-latent-reasoning

NLP final project — adaptive latent chain-of-thought reasoning.

We extend [SIM-CoT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20317) (ICLR 2026) to make the number of implicit reasoning steps **variable at inference time**, rather than fixed.


## Structure

```
baselines/           # Reference implementations (Coconut, CODI, SIM-CoT)
docs/papers/         # Paper summaries for context
```

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
# or
pip install -r baselines/CODI/requirements.txt
```

## Context for contributors

See `CLAUDE.md` for a full briefing on repo layout, subgroup strategies, and how to run the baselines.
