# 04-simcot-pondernet-gammasweep — Runs

See [experiment.md](experiment.md) for the frontier and the sweet-spot conclusion.
Accuracy = best operating point at thr=0.8; "min steps" = thr=0.5 efficiency point.

> Re-validated 2026-06-23 (partial): only `g0.05-gm3.0-ep5` (ep3) survived and was re-evaluated
> on the validation split (500 ex, greedy). The other 7 γ configs were deleted — their numbers
> are on the GSM8K test set (biased) and the sweep's winner-selection cannot be reproduced.
